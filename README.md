### Snowflake

Developed in 2012, Snowflake is a fully managed SaaS (software as a service) that provides a single platform for data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and secure sharing and consumption of real-time / shared data.  A Snowflake database is where an organizationâ€™s uploaded structured and semistructured data sets are held for processing and analysis. Snowflake automatically manages all parts of the data storage process, including organization, structure, metadata, file size, compression, and statistics.

### AWS VS SNOWFLAKES

Snowflake is different from AWS in the sense that it does not provide a comprehensive set of services. Snowflake is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that can be used to store data. AWS, on the other hand, provides a wide range of services, such as compute, storage, networking, and applications.
